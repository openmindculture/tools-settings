# Annotation, Documentation, and Code Comments 

## Description

This component emphasizes simplicity and adaptability. 
The update improves accesibility, inclusion, and readability.
It offers flexible design options, supported by a variety of patterns for different page types, such as services and landing pages, making it ideal for building personal blogs, professional portfolios, online magazines, or business websites. Its templates cater to various blog styles, from text-focused to image-heavy layouts. Additionally, it supports international typography and diverse color palettes, ensuring accessibility and customization for users worldwide.

Text content and order variations are intentional to benefit search engine optimization.

Accessibility and web performance are important non-functional requirements.

### Setup and Initial Functionality

This partial snippet can be included in all types of contact sections.
It will exit if accessed directly.
In this file, you can append custom step methods.

Use an editor configuration to define and unify the coding style for different editors and IDEs.

Define animations. Disable animations if the user prefers reduced motion.
Define possible colors.
Define web safe color and wide gamut variations using progressive enhancement.
Export theme colors. Export typography.
Define virtual static pages to prevent 404 not found error.
Display error messages in browser only in local dev setup.
To use console functions like `console.log`, set `"removeConsole"` to `false` in `babel.config.json` !
Define font typography in parent style file to simplify relative path handling.
Define custom title before including reusable header component.
Add theme support for post formats.
Enqueue editor styles in the editors.
Enqueue styles on the front-end.
Include common page parts from the `src/inc/` directory.
Register custom block styles.
Register pattern categories.
Register callbacks.
Refactor code.
Find problems.
Invoke the assistant.
Add more documentation and document typical cases to learn from.
Run anything.
Reduce fixed spacing and unset min-width on small screens.

### Build and Deployment

Distribution directories (`dist`, `dist_en`) are pushed to GitHub.
It is not necessary to re-build them on the "serverless" server,
Netlify can deploy the distributed content without further modification.
We must configure every domain in Netlify's domain settings as custom domains.
Note that Netlify does not respect `.htaccess` Apache configuration files, but needs a `_redirects` file instead.

### Progressive Enhancement

All content and technical updates must be accessible and should consider web performance and
progressive enhancement: content first, keep the site readable and usable without any style and script,
test tab-navigation, screen reader; use static code analysis (eslint, stylelint), automated audits
(axe, wave, lighthouse); run and update automated test scenarios!

The website should be fully functional and beautifully styled, including animation and interactivity,
using only HTML and CSS without any scripts or images. Saving the website as a PDF using the print dialog
should generate a printable document that resembles the website's style, contains all important information,
including readable and clickable links, and that can be used as a CV document.

DOM elements with visibility controlled by script, like `.sticky-header`,
must always stay visible without javascript, so we hide them by script when the document is ready.

### Requirements, Fallbacks, and Workarounds

The issue seems to be related to glib version as on stable debian we now have 2.31 (source https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/glibc) and current GDLauncher requires 2. What is glib? 
It is a low level core library.
Split Packages: glib2-devel, glib2-docs.
Architecture: x86_64.
Repository: Core.

How load image and create Gdk.Pixbuf from it used Gegl?

GEGL and its dependencies are known to build and run on Linux, Microsoft Windows with MSYS2/MINGW and Mac OSX. It probably can be built on other systems. GDK stands for the Microsoft Game Development Kit and for a graphics library used to compile GIMP, the GNU image manipulation program.

How to use jakarta tomcat deployment descriptor syntax?

The Jakarta Servlet deployment descriptor, commonly used with Jakarta Tomcat, is represented by the web.xml file located in the WEB-INF directory of a web application. This XML file is structured according to the web-app_X_Y.xsd schema. The complete syntax and semantics for the deployment descriptor is defined in Chapter 13 of the Servlet API Specification.

TODO reactivate workaround when obsoleted by a bug fix.
Ensure 3 search results, use latest posts as fallbacks for unsupported fuzzy search.
Fetch 3 more so that we can skip duplicates.
Require spam trap 'captcha' be empty, require message not empty.
Accept AJAX request from legitimate major modern browser users.
Provice a fallback for plain web form submit.
Harmonize vertical alignment.
Prevent iPhone mobile safari zooming in if page contains text smaller than 16px.
Optionally cross-fade with a pseudo page skeleton like in a JS application, unless the user prefers reduced motion.
Don’t headbutt the browser window.
Report inappropriate predictions.
Liquid render does not pass variables, but include does.

Flipping an element in a mouseover hover:
Define an additional hover zone to prevent hanging/blinking mouse over flip-flop like Mickey Mouse in flip-flop thongs. On hover the div code below works perfectly. But What I want is that, if someone only click on the button flip this flipping of div should work.

### Hidden Issues, Comments and Verbose Debugging

Undefined function get_template_directory

## Development, Testing, and Refactoring

TODO refactor and clean up!
Don’t let your default response header reveal technical details.
Styles have moved to style.css ;
Theme slug class name will be renamed to high-contrast style.
Re-integrating companion into main will make this theme obsolete.
See the changelog for detailed descriptions.

As a pragmatic workaround, we could use a classic dead-link-checker and check for search console errors after deployment.

Workaround TODO: copy the most critical design tokens manually to critical CSS ?
The proper solution is a per-file exception for postcss-custom-properties.
This should already be handled by utils/transform-css.js
but that does not work currently.
Liquid may not the right language in a JavaScript context, and Nunjucks would fit better?

### Testing

Set prepareScreenshotBaseImages to true to regenerate and save all screenshots.
Set prepareScreenshotBaseImages to compare upcoming tests to saved screenshots.
I can "see" something below the fold (implicitly scrolling it into view?)
