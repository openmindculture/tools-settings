Core Principles for AI-Ready Knowledge:

Clarity and Conciseness: AI models perform best with clear, unambiguous language. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice, and get straight to the point.

Atomicity/Granularity: Break down information into the smallest meaningful units. Instead of a long document covering many topics, create separate, focused entries for each concept, problem, or solution. This makes it easier for AI to retrieve specific, relevant pieces.

Consistency: Use consistent terminology, formatting, and organizational structures. This helps the AI identify patterns and relationships more effectively.

Contextual Richness: Even atomic units need context. Make sure each note or snippet provides enough information for the AI to understand what it is, why it's important, and how it's used.

Attribution/Provenance: If you're drawing from external sources, consider noting the source. This adds credibility and helps the AI (and you) verify information if needed.

Evolvability: Your knowledge base will grow and change. Design it to be easily updatable and extensible without requiring a complete overhaul.

II. Structuring Your Notes and Knowledge:

Markdown for Everything: Markdown is ideal. It's human-readable, machine-parseable, and widely supported.

Headings: Use clear, descriptive headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to structure your notes logically.

Lists: Use bullet points and numbered lists for steps, features, pros/cons, etc.

Code Blocks: Always use fenced code blocks (```language) to delineate code. Specify the language for syntax highlighting and AI understanding.

Bold/Italics: Use sparingly for emphasis, but rely more on clear structure.

YAML Front Matter (for structured metadata): If your note-taking tool supports it (like Obsidian or static site generators), consider adding YAML front matter. This provides structured metadata that AI can easily parse.
