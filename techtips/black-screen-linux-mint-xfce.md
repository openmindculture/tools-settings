# Black Screen with Movable Mouse Pointer after Logging into my Xfce Session in Linux Mint 22 Wilma

## a) Reboot/Retry

## b) Disable Screensaver and Update Software
- switch to a non-graphical console using Ctrl+Alt+F1, 
- if there is no cursor, try typing any key to make a prompt appear, and 
- log in, 
- remove the blackbox screensaver and update kernel and software:

```sh
sudo apt remove blackbox
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

After a successful upgrade, use Ctrl+Alt+F7 to switch back to the graphical desktop session.

So far, so good. Problem solved, next startup without problems.
However, the next day, the problem occurred again.
I retried the same solution/workaround, but still only a black screen with movable mouse pointer after Ctrl+Alt+F7.

## c) Start X session explicitly in a console session:
- switch to text console using Ctrl+Alt+F1,
- as there was no cursor, type any key,
- log in at the login prompt,
- ensure software is up to date: [code]sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade[/code]
- explicitly start the graphical system: [code]startx[/code]
- switch back to the graphical desktop session using Ctrl+Alt+F7
- type or click anywhere and wait for the desktop session to initialize.

This is generally not a good idea.

Killing running `startx`, `startxfce` or `lightdm` processes isn't either.

Cons:
- two conflicting X sessions
- respawning apps with no additional debug information

## d) BIOS/Kernel Fixes

- update UEFI BIOS
- upgrade kernel
- downgrade kernel
- switch to default kernel
- switch to vendor-provided kernel (e.g. 6.11.0-120029-tuxedo)
