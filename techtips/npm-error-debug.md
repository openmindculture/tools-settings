# npm dependency issues, overrides, bad engine errors

EBADENGINE can mostly be fixed by upgrading or downgrading the node and npm commands to the required version using nvm, the node version manager, e.g. `nvm use 22.12`. 

Override warnings are typically logged directly to your terminal during the npm install process. They appear as npm WARN messages. The warning will usually state which package is creating the conflict.

To find the specific reason for the override, you should:

Check the logs: The package manager will print a warning message when it performs an override. This message usually states which package requires a different version of the dependency.
