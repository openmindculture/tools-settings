# Publish as a GitHub Page

GitHub Pages sites are publicly available on the internet, even if the repository for the site is private.

[Configure a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)

We can reuse an existing interlinked `.md` or `.html` content collection by selection the root folder `/` as publishing source of our `main` branch (trunk) in our GitHub Page publishing source configuration.

If no custom domain name is used, the GitHub pages URL defaults to 
https://\<user.github.io\>/\<repository\>/

for example:
https://openmindculture.github.io/tools-settings/

## Automatically Link URLs

"References to URLs, issues, pull requests, and commits are automatically shortened and converted into links," but that does not work automatically on pages.github.com.
